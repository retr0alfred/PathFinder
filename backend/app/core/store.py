"""The generated overlay: topics the product learned about after it shipped.

The curated files (``skills.json``, ``courses.json``) are the seed. They are
hand-verified, they are checked into git, and nothing at runtime ever writes to
them. Everything discovered later -- a syllabus for quantum computing, the pages
found for organic chemistry -- lands in ``data/generated/`` instead.

Keeping the two apart buys three things that matter for a product people rely on:

**The seed cannot be corrupted.** A bad generation degrades the overlay and is
deleted with ``rm -r data/generated``; it can never damage the verified core.

**Provenance stays legible.** Every overlay record carries ``discovered=True``,
the query that produced it and when, so the interface can tell a learner "this
was found for you on 19 August" instead of implying it was curated.

**Growth is cumulative.** The overlay is append-only and shared: the first
learner to ask about quantum computing pays for the search, and everyone after
them gets it instantly. That is the difference between a product that improves
with use and a demo that repeats the same work forever.

Concurrency is handled by writing a temporary file and replacing atomically, so
a reader never observes half a topic, and by holding a process lock across the
read-modify-write so two simultaneous expansions cannot lose each other's work.
