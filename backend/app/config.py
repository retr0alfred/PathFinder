"""Application settings.

Every tunable lives here and is sourced from the environment (or a local `.env`
file) via pydantic-settings. Nothing else in the codebase may read `os.environ`
directly -- a single typed settings object keeps configuration auditable and
makes tests able to override behaviour by constructing `Settings(...)`.
