"""Prepare everything the app needs before it serves a request.

Creates the database schema and warms the read-only data layers. Idempotent by
construction: ``create_all`` only creates missing tables, so this runs on every
boot -- including inside the container, where the filesystem is wiped on each
rebuild and there is no migration step to rely on.

Warming the embedding model here is deliberate. The local model is downloaded
once (~130 MB) and cached; doing that during a visible "preparing" step is much
better than a mysterious pause on the learner's first question.
