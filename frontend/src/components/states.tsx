/**
 * Shared states and guidance: loading, empty, failed, degraded, and hints.
 *
 * They live in one file because they must look and behave identically on every
 * screen. An app that invents a new error style per page reads as unfinished,
 * and a page that silently renders nothing when the backend is down is worse
 * than one that says so and offers a way forward.
 *
 * `Hint` and `Callout` are here for the same reason: guidance should look like
 * part of the product, not like a sticker added afterwards.
